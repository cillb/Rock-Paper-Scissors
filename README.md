# Rock Paper Scissors

This plays a command line version of rock paper scissors with the computer as an opponent.

It specifically implements the modification invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.

The actual logic for the game is very simple, using a dictionary and an if statement to compare the player's choice versus the computer. Most of the program just adds some strings to be printed to the user as the game is being ran.
